* Trollbot ChangeLog *
**********************
2007-04-13: * Removed head/tail/generic pointers from network, decided to
              just have a single list, default at head for servers, channels,
              and users.
            * matchattr now works with the exception of channel flags, added
              TCL matchattr, PHP soon to follow.
2007-04-12: * Started ChangeLog again.
            * Added free_ functions for channel and user, they both take 
              care of children structs.
            * Added egg_matchattr for use with DCC partyline code.
            * More connections added with user system
