2007-05-01: * tconfigs merge properly now, also did some fixup on dcc in the select() loop

2007-04-30: * Documentation fixups
            * eliminated some bloat by getting rid of trigger head/tails
              the lists should always be aligned at head
           
2007-04-26: * Fixed autoconf stuff so make install now works as expected :)
            * added egg_chattr()
            * added crude python support
            * Started implementing a rehashing routine
            * fixed crash in trigger.c checking if foo->rest[0] was null instead of foo->rest
            * Reverse DCC now works
            * bind DCC now works
            * made changes so pub/msg binds are no longer stackable as per eggdrop specs
            * tconfig algo changes, added tconfig_merge for stacking config files instead
              of running them all through the file_to_tconfig()
           

2007-04-13: * Removed head/tail/generic pointers from network, decided to
              just have a single list, default at head for servers, channels,
              and users.
            * matchattr now works with the exception of channel flags, added
              TCL matchattr, PHP soon to follow.
2007-04-12: * Started ChangeLog again.
            * Added free_ functions for channel and user, they both take 
              care of children structs.
            * Added egg_matchattr for use with DCC partyline code.
            * More connections added with user system
