* Trollbot ChangeLog *
**********************
2007-05-07: * added nonblocking connect() for dcc sessions so badly formatted requests 
              don't cause the bot to hang.
            * Added tstrcasecmp and tstrncasecmp in util.c because most IRCDs send nicks
              chans, etc exacly as typed, ie /dcc chat trollbot != /dcc chat TrollBot.
            * Modified the MSG/MSGM triggers to use new case insensitive strcasecmp fixing
              numerous problems with case sensitivity.
            * Added egg_hand2idx and egg_idx2hand to egg_lib.c
            * Added .who for DCC to show who is on the partyline
            * Added utility funcs for each LL to properly add (and some del) elements to
              a list.
            * Fixed putdcc to use a network specific IDX instead of a global DCC system
            * Added function descriptions to prototypes in egg_lib.h         

2007-05-01: * tconfigs merge properly now, also did some fixup on dcc in the select() loop
            * Added .tbinds command to list all bot binds, their command, and use count
            * Added uhost parameter to user struct, for easy matching with egg_finduser
            * Added egg_finduser()

2007-04-30: * Documentation fixups
            * eliminated some bloat by getting rid of trigger head/tails
              the lists should always be aligned at head
           
2007-04-26: * Fixed autoconf stuff so make install now works as expected :)
            * added egg_chattr()
            * added crude python support
            * Started implementing a rehashing routine
            * fixed crash in trigger.c checking if foo->rest[0] was null instead of foo->rest
            * Reverse DCC now works
            * bind DCC now works
            * made changes so pub/msg binds are no longer stackable as per eggdrop specs
            * tconfig algo changes, added tconfig_merge for stacking config files instead
              of running them all through the file_to_tconfig()
           

2007-04-13: * Removed head/tail/generic pointers from network, decided to
              just have a single list, default at head for servers, channels,
              and users.
            * matchattr now works with the exception of channel flags, added
              TCL matchattr, PHP soon to follow.
2007-04-12: * Started ChangeLog again.
            * Added free_ functions for channel and user, they both take 
              care of children structs.
            * Added egg_matchattr for use with DCC partyline code.
            * More connections added with user system
