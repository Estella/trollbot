Trollbot has the following coding standards.

* Indentation of 2 or 4 characters, never tab
* includes follow the following order:
    A. Standard Includes
    B. conditional includes
    C. config.h (for autoheader defines)
    D. trollbot includes (irc.h, trigger.h, etc)
* all declarations of structs and defines are to be put in
  the header file, never the .c files.
* curly braces get their own line
* no uppercase letters in trollbot functions or variables.
* no external dependancies other than stdlib and scripting libraries.
* all macros should be uppercase
* typedefs are highly discouraged.
