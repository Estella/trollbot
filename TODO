  own channel and user databases and also scripting namespaces.
  It will be done by using a simple syntax in the conf file such as
  chan = DALnet:#php
  and scripting as simple as
  tclscript = DALnet:scripts/foo.tcl
  also possible per channel namespaces using
  tclscript = DALnet:#php:scripts/foo.tcl


X capable of having different nicknames on different networks 

* capable of detecting max IRC line sizes and splitting up output
  to wrap instead of just truncating it. (eggdrop annoyance)

  of switching encryption on password ok, for smooth transitions
  and because you can't decrypt hashed passwords.
