Description:
  
  TrollBot is a multi-network capable bot designed to be a
replacement for eggdrop. Eggdrop has grown stale, and people
have been asking for perl scripting forever. It seems like
their branch will never come, so I created a bot that will
be scriptable in TCL, PHP, Perl, and Python. I also removed
the need for any scripting language to exist for basic core
functions (such as reading the config file). Eggdrop did have
a comprehensive library so tcl scripts could use all possible
information that the bot has. I have duplicated this library
and extended it to PHP, Perl, and Python, as well as added
some improvements of my own, see SCRIPTING.
